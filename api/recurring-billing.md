Recurring billing
=================

At this stage, automatic recurring payments functionality is out of scope for this library.
This is because there is likely far too many differences between how each gateway handles
recurring billing profiles. Also in most cases token billing will cover your needs, as you can
store a credit card then charge it on whatever schedule you like. Feel free to get in touch if
you really think this should be a core feature and worth the effort.
